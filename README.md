***1. What is the use of github*** <br><br>
GitHub is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code.<br>
The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project.<br>
The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software.<br>

***2. Private repository vs Public repository***<br>
Internal repositories are not visible to people outside of the enterprise account, including outside collaborators on organization repositories.<br>
Public Repositories : They're visible to any user on your GitHub Enterprise instance.<br>
Private Repositories : They're only available to the repository owner. You can add collaborators of your choise to share with.<br>

***3.How to clone***<br><br>
Cloning is a process of creating an identical copy of a Git Remote Repository to the local machine.

Cloning Repositories
The git clone command is used to copy an existing Git repository from a server to the local machine

* git clone https://github.com/Aishanaya01/Task.git clones the repo in your current directory.
* git clone https://github.com/Aishanaya01/Task.git MyFolder : clones the repo into MyFolder in your current directory.

***4.How to create branches***<br>
Branching<br>
* git branch <name> : create a new branch while staying on the current branch
 * git checkout <name> : switch to an existing branch
* git checkout -b <name> : create a new branch and switch to it
* git branch <name> [<start-point>] : can be another branch name, commit SHA, HEAD or a tag name Example:
* git checkout-b<name> some_other_branch
* git checkout-b<name> 
* git checkout-b<name> you will lose uncommitted work
* git checkout-b<name> v1.0.5
* git checkout - : quick switch to previous branch
Delete a remote branch
* git push origin :<branchName> : delete a branch on the origin remote repository
* git push origin -d <branchName>
Delete a local branch
* git branch -d <branchName> : not delete if it has unmerged changes
* git branch -D <branchName> : deletes even if it has unmerged changes

***5. how to commit***<br>
The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.
Git does not add changes to a commit automatically. You need to indicate which file and changes need to be saved before running the Git commit command.
The commit command does not save changes in remote servers, only in the local repository of Git.
syntax:
```git commit -m '<topic> -m '<description>' : commit files staged with a message```

***6.How to change commit messages***<br>
```* git commit --amend -m "New message" : specify the commit message```
git amend

Note: Be aware that amending the most recent commit replaces it entirely and the previous commit is removedfrom the branch's history. This should be kept in mind when working with public repositories and on branches withother collaborators.

This means that if the earlier commit had already been pushed, after amending it you will have to git push --force.<br>

Commit message<br>
* git commit -m "Commit summary" -m "More detailed description follows here" : can pass in multiple -m arguments<br>
Creating an empty commit<br>
* git commit -m "This is a blank commit" --allow-empty : able to easily create commits without having to edit/touch a dummy file.<br>
The --allow-empty commit will bypass the check.<br>

Committing on behalf of someone else<br>
git commit-m "msg" --author "John Smith <johnsmith@example.com>" : can give them credit with the --author option.

***7.What is git stash***<br>
Sometimes you want to switch the branches, but you are working on an incomplete part of your current project. You don't want to make a commit of half-done work. Git stashing allows you to do so. 
The git stash command enables you to switch branches without committing the current branch<br>
Generally, the stash's meaning is "store something safely in a hidden place." <br>
The sense in Git is also the same for stash; Git temporarily saves your data safely without committing.<br>
syntax:<br>
```* git stash : stashes all tracked files.<br>

* git stash --include-untracked/-u : include all untracked files<br>

* git stash save "message" : message with your stash to make it identifiable<br>

* git stash -keep-index/-k : leave the staging area in current state after stash<br>```

List saved stashes<br>
git stash list : all stashes in the stack in reverse chronological order<br>
Show Stash<br>
git stash show : show the changes saved in the last stash<br>
git stash show stash@{n} : specific stash<br>
git stash show -p stash@{n} : content of the specific stash<br>  

***8.How to get back stashed content***<br>
To retrieve changes out of the stash and apply them to the current branch youâ€™re on, you have two options:<br>

git stash apply STASH-NAME applies the changes and leaves a copy in the stash<br>
syntax:<br>
```git stash apply : apply last stash without removing it<br>```
git stash pop STASH-NAME applies the changes and removes the files from the stash<br>
syntax:<br>
```git stash pop : apply last stash and remove it from the stack<br>```
***9. What is origin***<br>
"origin" is the name of the remote repository where you want to publish you commits. By convention, the default remote repository is called "origin",<br>
 but you can work with several remotes (with different names) as the same time.<br>
 if you require more information about origin go just go with this Sometimes<br>

 ***10.How to merge***<br>

 ```git merge <another_branch> : make sure you are in the branch that is getting merged into.```<br>
```git merge --abort : after starting a merge, you might want to stop the merge and return everything to its pre-merge state<br>```
```git merge <branch_name> --no-ff -m"<commit message>" : merge with a commit as default behaviour in fast-forward only updates the branch pointer without creating a merge commit.```<br>

***11.How to resolve conflict***<br>



***12.what is pull request***<br>
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the<br> potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.<br><br>

***13.what is tags***<br>
Git tags are like milestones, markers or a specific point in the repo's history marked as significant. Tags are usually used to mark stable releases or achievement of
 very important milestones. Tags can help the users of the repo to easily navigate to the important parts of the code history like release points.
